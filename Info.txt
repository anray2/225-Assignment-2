The three images and their descriptions are:
‘DT11701.jpg’ = Portrait of a Lady
Bequest of Mrs. Heinrich Meyn, for her friend, Anna Mary King, 1925

DP244873.jpg’ = Hagar and the Angel" by Francesco Maffei
Maffei, who lived and worked in the cities of Vicenza and Padua, was profoundly influenced by the art of Bassano, Tintoretto, and Veronese, his Venetian predecessors. His style is characteristic for its elegance, far removed from realism. This scene from the biblical book of Genesis shows the angel appearing to Hagar. Having been banished by Abraham to the desert with her infant Ishmael, she is saved by a heavenly creature who directs her to a spring of water.

DP-14344-001.jpg = The Abduction of Rebecca by Eugene Delacroix
Throughout his career, Delacroix was inspired by the novels of Sir Walter Scott, a favorite author of the French Romantics. This painting depicts a scene from Ivanhoe: the Jewish heroine Rebecca, who had been confined in the castle of Front de Boeuf (seen in flames), is carried off by two Saracen slaves commanded by the covetous Christian knight Bois-Guilbert. The contorted, interlocking poses and compacted space, which shifts abruptly from the elevated foregound to the fortress behind, create a sense of intense drama. Apart from the still life at lower left, the only element of calm is Rebecca herself.
